Tools to build bilayer graphene total energy and tight binding models

modules include:
  - Fitting interatomic potentials for bilayer graphene
  - Fitting Tight Binding models for bilayer graphene
  - running Markov Chain Monte Carlo uncertainty quantification for said models
  - running uncertainty propagation for relaxations and band structures
